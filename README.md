I am a mobile developer with a focus on iOS and Android applications, accumulating two years of dynamic experience in projects spanning the financial and e-commerce sectors. Throughout this period, I actively contributed to the development of essential features such as Pix integration, Correios (Brazilian postal service) integration, carrier management, and payment system integration.

I possess strong knowledge of various architectures, including MVVM, MVVM-C, and MVP. My expertise extends to deployment automation using Fastlane, ensuring efficient app publishing and distribution on the App Store and Play Store. Over the course of my career, I have been extensively involved in White Label projects, working with languages such as Swift, Java, and Kotlin.

Some of my skills and tools include reactive programming with RxSwift/RxCocoa, dependency management using Cocoapods, Firebase integration, extensive familiarity with UIKit and SwiftUI, as well as solid proficiency in Git. I am also well-versed in using Moya and Alamofire, and I have practical experience in conducting unit tests to ensure product quality.

I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities for personal and professional growth.
